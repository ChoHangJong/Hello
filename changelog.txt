- Changes view:
    - internal error related to CR line endings, especially with forced text on binary files
    - Unified view: clicking [x] did not work in all situations
    - Working tree window: switching between Working Tree and Index table should focus first change if a different file is selected

    $ smartgit.exe --add-tool type=merge pattern=*.eap "command=C:\Program Files\mergetool.exe" "parameters=${leftFile} ${rightFile} ${baseFile} ${mergedFile}"
